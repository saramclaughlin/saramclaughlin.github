In the Spring of 2025 I took a Quantitative Reasoning class based in R. I wrote code and performed data science associated with environmental and ecological data. Here is a collection of links to my completed projects from this course:

-   Made a new Github repository
-   Set up a Quarto website with multiple pages
-   Populated the website with images and links
