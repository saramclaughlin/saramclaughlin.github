An emerging conservation biologist with a special interest in ecological fieldwork, I am skilled in scientific research, data organization and analysis, and sustainable practices. I seek to utilize my expertise in organizations dedicated to conservation ecology and biology. Outside of my academic and professional endeavors, I enjoy spending my time hiking, camping, reading, or practicing yoga and meditation.
